# West Metro Softball Registration

## Description
_Duration: 2 week sprint_


## Make a Plan


## Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/v1.php) - recommended

## Installation
1. Fork and clone this repository for your own access.
2. Run an `npm install` within this repository's root directory.
3. Create a database named `saga_movies_weekend`.
    * This application is configured to connect to a PostgreSQL database. You'll need to create this database within a locally installed PostgreSQL instance.
4. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly.
   * I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries
5. Run `npm run server` in your terminal to start the Express server.
6. Run `npm run client` in your terminal to start the Vite dev server (which servers the React app).
7. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/.
